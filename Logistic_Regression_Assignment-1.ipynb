    "Linear regression and logistic regression are both types of regression models, but they are used for different types of prediction tasks. Here's a breakdown of their key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type of Dependent Variable:\n",
    "- Linear Regression: Used when the dependent variable (target) is continuous and can take any value within a range. For example, predicting house prices, temperature, or sales figures.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: Used when the dependent variable is categorical, typically binary (i.e., two classes, such as 0 or 1). For example, predicting whether a customer will buy a product (yes/no), or if a patient has a disease (positive/negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Output:\n",
    "- Linear Regression: Predicts a continuous output. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features (independent variables) and the target.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: Predicts a probability that an instance belongs to a certain class, with the final output being a class label (e.g., 0 or 1). It uses the logistic function (or sigmoid function) to transform the predicted values into a probability between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Loss Function:\n",
    "- Linear Regression: Minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: Minimizes the log loss (also known as cross-entropy loss), which measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example for logistic regression: Predicting whether a customer will make a purchase (yes/no) based on their browsing behavior."

    "Regularization in logistic regression is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. Overfitting happens when the model becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of generalizing well to new data. Regularization discourages the model from assigning too much importance (high weights) to individual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Regularization Helps: Regularization limits the size of the coefficients, ensuring that no feature is overly influential. This forces the model to focus on the most important features and ignore noise, which helps it generalize better to unseen data, thus reducing overfitting."
