    "- Adopt a Mobile-First Approach: Begin designing for smaller screens first. This ensures essential content and features are prioritized, and the UI scales up effectively for larger screens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement Flexible Grid Layouts: Use CSS grid or flexbox to create fluid layouts that adjust dynamically to different screen sizes, making the UI adaptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define Responsive Breakpoints: Use CSS media queries to apply different styles at specific screen widths, ensuring the layout adjusts smoothly across various devices.\n",
    "\n",

    "Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consistent Navigation: Implement adaptable navigation patterns like collapsible menus to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.\n",

    "- Performance Optimization: Minimize resource-heavy elements and use techniques like lazy loading to ensure fast loading times.\n",
    "- Accessibility: Follow web accessibility standards to make the UI usable for everyone.\n"
